	* Immigration Economics: A Review
	* [article](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/card-peri-jel-april-6-2016.pdf)
	* Criticizes a book from George Borjas (Immigration economics, from now on, referred as IE)
	* Says the contribution of the book is one-sided, with little to no attention to some of the benefits proposed by immigration in the host country market
	* George Borjas is the leading economic scholar of immigration
	* Book is of graduate level
	* IE focuses almost exclusively on the labor market, specifically understanding the determinantes of immigrants earnings
	* Finds significant biases employed in the economic models that were developed from the correlations, thus, making the bias larger as larger is the initial share of immigrantes in the labor market

	* Impact of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami Labor Market
	* [article](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf)

	* Do Immigrant workers depress the wages of native workers?
	* [article](https://giovanniperi.ucdavis.edu/uploads/5/6/8/2/56826033/peri_do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers.pdf)
	* Despite the common sense, no evidence was found to support that immigrant workers depress wages of natives
	* Mostly, native workers' wages have been insulated by differences in skills, specialization
	* There's some evidence of a negative effect of newly settled immigrants on the wages of earlier immigrants
	* Positive wage effects are weaker in countries with rigid labor markets
